## 📝 Approach

### 1. Data Preparation

* Load and inspect the dataset.
* Handle missing, inconsistent, and duplicate values.
* Standardize categorical variables like `Weather`, `Traffic`, `Vehicle`, and `Area`.

### 2. Feature Engineering

* Calculate geospatial distances using store and drop coordinates.
* Extract time-based features: hour of day, day of week, and month.
* Encode categorical variables for regression models.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyze distributions and trends in `Delivery_Time`.
* Visualize the impact of `Traffic`, `Weather`, and `Product Category` on delivery times.
* Explore agent performance and relationships between variables.

**Key Visualizations**:

* Bar charts: Delivery time by product category
* Scatter plots: Distance vs. delivery time
* Heatmaps: Correlation between agent rating and delivery time

### 4. Regression Model Development

* Models developed:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regressor
  * Gradient Boosting Regressor
* Evaluate performance using:

  * **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
  * **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
  * **R² Score**
* Track models using **MLflow** for comparison and versioning.

### 5. Application Development

* Streamlit interface for end-users:

  * Input order details (distance, traffic, weather, etc.)
  * Display predicted delivery times dynamically

### 6. Deployment

* Deploy the Streamlit application for accessibility and scalability.
